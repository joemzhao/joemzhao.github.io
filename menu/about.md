Greeting, welcome to Mengjie Zhao's small corner on the Web!



Currently I am a researcher at [Sony Group
Corporation](https://www.sony.com/en/), living in
[Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), Japan.  I have been
working and researching about [natural language
processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
(NLP) for more than seven years. 

My main focus now is to research and develop
**multimodal LLMs and LLM agents for solving real-world problems**.  I am also
working on large-scale pretraining (>200 GPUs) for learning
semantic representations of data in various modalities: text, image, video,
audio, and music.

Previously I did my Ph.D. in computer science in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich">University
of Munich</a>, Germany, working with Prof. Dr. <a
href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en">
Hinrich Sch&uuml;tze</a>.
